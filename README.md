# CabBooking

The Cab Booking Python Program is a command-line application that allows users to easily book, view, and manage cab rides. Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, the program simulates a real-world cab booking system by providing core functionalities such as registering users, searching for available cabs, booking rides, and viewing trip history.

Key Features:

- User Registration & Login: Users can create accounts and securely log in to access personalized services.
- Search for Cabs: Users can input their pickup and drop-off locations to find available cabs.
- Book a Cab: After selecting a cab, users can confirm their booking, with details stored within the system.
- View Booking History: Users can review past trips and booking details.
- Admin Panel (Optional): An administrator can manage cab listings, user accounts, and view overall system data.

Implementation Details:

- The program uses Pythonâ€™s built-in data structures such as dictionaries and lists to manage user data, cab details, and bookings.
- It employs functions to modularize features like registration, login, searching, and booking.
- Data persistence can be achieved through simple file handling (e.g., CSV or JSON files) to store user and booking information.
- The program features a menu-driven interface for easy navigation and interaction.

Potential Extensions:

- Integration with real map APIs for location services.
- Payment processing simulation.
- Real-time cab availability updates.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter.

This Python cab booking program serves as an excellent project for beginners to understand fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, data management, and function utilization, while also providing a foundation for developing more complex ride-hailing applications.
